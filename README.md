Various functions to ease working with time series in `pandas`.

 - Scrape series from the UK Office for National Statistics, Bank of England, and International Monetary Fund.
 - Use X-13ARIMA-SEATS to deseasonalise time series
 - Compute CAGRs and trends

## Installation

### Basic

Download and unpack the files from Github, then run `python setup.py install` in the root directory.

### Pip

To install with `pip` run

    python setup.py sdist
    pip install dist\pydatafuncs-X.X.X.zip

where `X.X.X` is the version number.

## Usage

### `scrape` module

Despite the advent of [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com) there are still many series an analyst will need that are only available in spreadsheets. The functions here will pull your desired time series into a pandas dataframe. There are three core functions in the module:

 - `from_ONS(dataset, series, freq)`: Scrapes the CSV files on [the ONS website](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/index.html?content-type=Dataset&pubdateRangeType=allDates&sortBy=pubdate&sortDirection=DESCENDING&newquery=*&pageSize=50&applyFilters=true&content-type-orig=%22Dataset%22+OR+content-type_original%3A%22Reference+table%22).
 - `from_BoE(series, datefrom=None, yearsback=5, vpd='y')`: Scrapes from the Bank of England's [Interactive Database](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/iadb/newintermed.asp).
 - `from_IMF(dataset, series=None, countries=None)`: Scrapes the IMF's [World Economic Outlook](http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29) and [Public Finances in Modern History Database](http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/histdb/).


### `deseasonalise` module

Python wrapper on X-13ARIMA-SEATS to deseasonalise time series data. Takes and returns a `pandas` dataframe. Requires [X-13ARIMA-SEATS](https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/) executable to be installed. Module has one function, `deseasonalise`, which takes either a dataframe or series and returns the same adjusted.

The default path to X-13 is `C:/Program Files (x86)/x13as/x13as.exe` but can be changed in `config.py`.

### `compute` module

 - `cagr(ser, end, freq='A', yrs=4)`: Calculates the compound annual growth rate of the time series.
 - `trend(ser, start=pd.datetime(1998, 3, 31), yrs=5)`: Calculate the trend line of the time series.
